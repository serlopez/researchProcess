            <h3>to the teacher</h3>
            <p>
                this is a basic library and information literacy tutorial. it is modelled very generally after the typical one-shot instruction session most students experience in higher education classes that include a research component or assignment.

            </p>
            <p>
                this tutorial is organized in seven chapters, covering each step in the research process as defined here. this division in chapters allows the teacher to deliver any material they consider relevant or necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                it is designed to be taught remotely, in person, synchronously and asynchronously, both with guided assistance and self-taught. it can be taught online and offline if saved locally. it is done using html, javascript, and css. there is no need for huge libraries or dependencies. it is not platform-specific and it does not require special software or hardware other than a typical smart device and a modern browser to run. it is made to run on most devices, including most smart phones. at its barebones, it retains its functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                this tutorial is marked up in such a way that is accessible to screen readers and other devices and tools, according to <a target="new" href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">w3c standards</a>.

            <h3>to the student.</h3>
            <p>this is a basic library research tutorial. by the end of it, you sould be able to conduct basic academic research for your term paper, essay, speech, presentation, or any other project that requires you to do quality academic research.</p>
            <p>the tutorial consists of seven chapters, plus appendices on relevant topics.</p>
            <p>each chapter is divided as follows:</p>
            <ul id="chapter_org">
                <li>title.</li>
                <li>objective: what I expect you to know at the end of each chapter.</li>
                <li>vocabulary: words or terms important to understand the chapter.</li>
                <li>the chapter’s main content.</li>
                <li>conclusion: the main ideas of the chapter.</li>
                <li>activities: optional but recommended.</li>
                <li>auto-evaluation: a quiz of five questions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>depending on your needs as a class, you will go over one or more chapters. however, a basic understanding of the whole class will prove very useful.</p>
            <p><strong>let's go.</strong></p>

                    <p>writing an essay, composing a speech, or putting together a presentation can all be thought of as processes.</p>
                    <p>the research process, as the name indicates, is the process of doing research.</p>
                    <p>when it comes to library research, the research process consists of the following steps:</p>
                    <ul id="research_steps">
                        <li>knowing the assignment's specifics and deadlines.</li>
                        <li>choosing a topic.</li>
                        <li>finding background information in reference publications.</li>
                        <li>looking for specific information using library resources and the web.</li>
                        <li>organizing found information in a logical manner.</li>
                        <li>citing, formatting, and packaging for delivery.</li>

                    <p>
                        these steps are part of a process. processes are most effective when youn follow the steps in a logical manner, as above.

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        in addition to general information about your topic, you will want to learn the specific teminology, key words, and special vocabulary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use encyclopedias, dictionaries, and wikipedia, to find background information.

                    <p>
                        yes, <strong>use wikipedia, just don't tell anyone you did</strong>.

                    <p>
                        wikipedia is a great place to begin research, as long as you keep in mind that <strong>wikipedia is a place, not a source</strong>. we don’t cite places, we cite sources. use wikipedia’s reference list to find the source, and <strong>cite the source</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        none of your statements should ever begin with "according to wikipedia,..." or "wikipedia says...". if you find yourself doing this, stop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        become familiar with the core concepts, special vocabulary, and maybe relevant people in your subject or topic.

                    <p>
                        encyclopedias, dictionaries, and wikipedia provide you with background information to begin research, introduce you to the topic, and allow you to discover useful keywords and key terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        however, this information is usually not enough. for more substantial information, we need to use the resources found in your library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        your college (or public<a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>) library is the place where you will find books using the library catalog, and academic journal articles using the library’s electronic databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        books are the best choice when looking for in-depth information about a topic. <strong>books usually talk about one thing for a very long time</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        when looking for books, start with a broad subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        books are found in the library using the library catalog.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>note: the instructions below and the rest of this chapter references a very specific library. If you are a student other than a <a target="new" href="https://www.mhcc.edu/">mhcc</a> student, the way you access and use your own library catalog and databases might be a bit different, but not by much, since the logic is the same. ask a librarian if you have any questions. They will be more than happy to help you.</i>

                    <p>to find books in the library catalog:</p>
                    <ul id="librarycatalog">

                        <li>type your keyword(s) and click <strong>search</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>search</strong> will take you to the library catalog proper, a list of the items in the library matching the keywords you provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        observe that you will find, in addition to books in print, ebooks, streaming video, dvd, even some journal articles. however, you will use the library catalog when you are looking for books and ebooks for the most part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if you are looking for ebooks, select ebooks under resource type. likewise for print books, or any other format available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        click on the title of the book of your choice. notice the detailed information about the book, its location in the library, and other useful tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        as you inspect the book, first notice title, author, publication date, and summary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        then look at the book’s availability: here you can find out if the book is in the library and where in the shelves it’s located. if it’s an ebook, accessing it and reading it is usually just a matter of following links.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        lastly, notice the tools field. here you will find the correct citation in the style of your choice under the "cite" icon, for when the time comes to cite your sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if we don’t have the book you need, and another library has it and it’s willing to lend it, we can get the book for you through summit or interlibrary loan (ill).

                    <h4>searching for journal articles in library databases</h4>
                    <img class = "left_screen" src="images/reached-city-1600.jpg" alt="reached city.">
                    <p>
                        while books talk about only one broad thing, in depth, for a very long time, journal articles found in databases typically <strong>talk about very specific things, for a short period of time</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        make sure you know the difference between library, database, journal, and article, as well as their relationship:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>library { databases { journals { articles } } }.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        to find journal articles from the library: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>locate the library research link</li>
                        <li>at the library research page, click the <strong>databases</strong> link</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        here you will find the <strong>find articles</strong> page. from here you can find databases either by name through the a-z or by subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        examples of the databases you will find the most useful are <a target="new" href="https://web-b-ebscohost-com.ezp.mhcc.edu/ehost/search/advanced?vid=0&sid=bd8113da-4b08-43d3-9aaf-d89eafebae8e%40pdc-v-sessmgr05">academic search complete</a>, <a target="new" href="https://go-gale-com.ezp.mhcc.edu/ps/start.do?p=PPPM&u=mthoodcc">popular magazines</a>, and <a target="new" href = "https://go-gale-com.ezp.mhcc.edu/ps/start.do?p=OVIC&u=mthoodcc">opposing viewpoints</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        for the most part, databases’ use and structure are very similar. they mainly differ in subject matter and scope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        click the database's link. if you see a page asking you for your <a target="new" href="https://mhcc.edu/">mhcc</a> id number and <a target="new" href="https://my.mhcc.edu/ics">mymhcc</a> password, please have it ready (not an issue if you do this from campus).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if everything goes as expected, you will see the database’ initial search page. type your keywords<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>, use <a href="#boolean-operators">boolean logic</a> if necessary, select articles in full text, select peer-reviewed if the professor specified it, date of publication limits if desired, and press search.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if your search is successful, the results page will show you a list of articles relevant<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> to your keywords. select an article by clicking its title.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        here you will find more information about the article, including the title, authors, journal name, and, most importantly, the abstract. <strong>the abstract is your friend!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if you think this article is good for your project, access is by clicking the full text link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        lastly, here you can print the article, save it to a flash drive, even the database will give you a folder to save your research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        the easiest way to keep your research articles is to have the database email them to you. all your research in one place within reach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        at the full text page, you will also find the correct citation for the article, in the style of your choice. copy and paste the citation. the database can also send you the article’s citation by email, along with the article, if you choose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        you may be able to find articles easier using <a target="new" href="https://scholar.google.com/">google scholar</a>. however, accessing databases using scholar is like trying to get in using the back door. if you find and try to download an article through google scholar, you will likely get a message saying basically "who the hell are you? give me $30".

                        while library resources may be more than enough for your project, you may have to go to the web to get the information you need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        since we use the web everyday, we might as well learn how to use it properly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>domain</strong>: the .(dot)something ending of each website's name. each website has a domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        therefore, websites can be classified by domains, depending on their origin, function, content, and/or purpose.
                    </p>
                    <ul id="domains_list">
                        <li>.com (personal or commercial)</li>
                        <li>.net (personal or commercial. less popular)</li>
                        <li>.org (non-for-profit, charitable organizations)</li>
                        <li>.edu (colleges and universities, research institutions)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        knowing about domains comes in handy because we can use them to get better quality information from the internet by searching within a specific domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        to search the internet within a specific domain, we use the site: command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        here's how it works:
                    </p>
                    <ul id="site_command_howto">
                        <li>open your browser.</li>
                        <li>in google search, type your keyword or question.</li>
                        <li>type <strong>site:</strong><i>domain or website</i> after or before your question, then click the search button.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        this works not just for domains, it also allows you to find information within a single website using its <strong>url</strong>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="conclusion">conclusion: the <i>site:</i> command is a powerful tool you can use to search the web for quality information for your project.</h3>
