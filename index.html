            <h2 id = "foreword">foreword: what is this and what it is for</h2>
            <p>the purpose of this class is to teach higher education students, anyone else interested, and you, hopefully, how to do library research.</p>
            <p>this class is designed to be both self taught, taught online, or in person, both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>
            <p>the class consists of seven small chapters plus appendices on relevant topics.</p>
            <p>each chapter is divided as follows:</p>
            <ul id="chapter_org">
                <li>title</li>
                <li>objective: what I expect you to know at the end of each chapter.</li>
                <li>vocabulary: words or terms key to understanding the chapter.</li>
                <li>the chapter’s main content.</li>
                <li>conclusion: the main ideas of the chapter.</li>
                <li>activities: optional but good to reinforce your understanding.</li>
                <li>auto-evaluation: a small exercise, often a small quiz, to review what you learned.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>depending on your or your professor’s needs, you will go over one or more chapters. however, a basic understanding of the whole class will prove very useful.</p>
