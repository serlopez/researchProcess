            <p>the purpose of this class is to teach higher education students, anyone else interested, and you, hopefully, how to do library research.</p>
            <p>this class is designed to be both self taught, taught online, or in person, both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>
            <p>the class consists of seven small chapters plus appendices on relevant topics.</p>
            <p>each chapter is divided as follows:</p>
            <ul id="chapter_org">
                <li>title</li>
                <li>objective: what I expect you to know at the end of each chapter.</li>
                <li>vocabulary: words or terms key to understanding the chapter.</li>
                <li>the chapter’s main content.</li>
                <li>conclusion: the main ideas of the chapter.</li>
                <li>activities: optional but good to reinforce your understanding.</li>
                <li>auto-evaluation: a small exercise, often a small quiz, to review what you learned.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>depending on your or your professor’s needs, you will go over one or more chapters. however, a basic understanding of the whole class will prove very useful.</p>

                        encyclopedias, dictionaries, and wikipedia provide background information to begin research, introduce you to the topic, and provide useful keywords and key terms.

                    <p>
                        however, this information is usually not enough. for more substantial information, we need to use the resources found in your library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        through your college (or public library) you will find books using the library catalog and academic quality articles using the library’s electronic databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        books are the best choice when looking for in-depth information about a topic. books usually talk about one thing for a very long time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        when looking for books, start with a broad subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        books are found in the library using the library catalog.
                    </p>
                    <p>to find books in the library catalog:</p>
                    <ul id="librarycatalog">
                        <li>locate the library catalog</li>
                        <li>type your keyword(s) and click "search"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        search will take you to the library catalog, a list of the items in the library matching the search terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        observe that you will find, in addition to books in print, ebooks, streaming video, dvd, even some journal articles. however, we use the library catalog when we are looking for books and ebooks in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if you are looking for eBooks, select ebooks under resource type. likewise for print books, or any other format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        click on the title of the book of your choice. notice the detailed information about the book, its location and useful tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        first, notice title, author, publication date and summary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        now look at the book’s availability: here you can find out if the book is available and where in the shelves it’s located. if it’s an ebook, it's usually just a matter of following links.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        lastly, notice the tools field. here you will find the correct citation in the style of your choice, for when the time comes to cite your sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if we don’t have the book you need and another library has it and it’s willing to lend it, we can get the book for you by summit or interlibrary loan (ill).
                    </p>
                    <h4>searching for articles in library databases</h4>
                    <p>
                        while books talk about only one thing, in depth, for a very long time, journal articles found in databases usually talk about many, very specific things, for a short period of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        make sure you know the difference between database, journal, and article, as well as their relationship.

                        <strong>library { databases { journal { articles } } }.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        to find journal articles from the library: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>locate the library research link</li>
                        <li>at the library research page, click the databases link</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        here you will find the find articles page. from here you can find databases either by name through the a-z or by subject.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        examples of the databases you will find the most useful are academic search complete, popular magazines, and opposing viewpoints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        for the most part, databases’ use and structure are very similar:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        click the database's link. if you see a page asking you for your mhcc id number and mymhcc password, please have it ready (not an issue if you do this from campus).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if everything goes as expected, you will see the database’ initial search page. type your keywords, use boolean logic if necessary, select articles in full text, peer-reviewed if the professor specified it, date of publication limits if desired, and press search.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if your search is successful, the results page will show a list of articles relevant to your keywords. select an article by clicking its title.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        here you will find more information about the article, including the title, authors, journal name, and, most importantly, the abstract. the abstract is your friend!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        if you think this article is good for your project, access is by clicking the full text link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        lastly, here you can print the article, save it to a flash drive, even the database will give you a folder to save your research. the easiest way is to have the database email you the articles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        here is where you will find the correct citation, in the style of your choice, copy and paste the citation. the database can also send you the article’s citation by email, along with the article.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        you may be able to find articles easier through google scholar. however, accessing databases using scholar is like trying to get in using the back door. if you try to download through google scholar, you will likely get a message asking who the hell are you and demanding $30. we will talk about searching the web in more detail below.

                        while library resources may be more than enough for your project, you may have to go to the web to get the information you need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        besides, since we use it everyday, we might as well know how to use it properly.

                        domain: the .something ending of each website's name. each website has its domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        websites can be classified by domains, depending on their origin, function, content, and/or purpose.
                    </p>
                    <ul id="domains_list">

                    <p>
                        knowing about domains comes in handy because we can use them to get better quality information from the internet by searching within a specific domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        to search the internet within a specific domain, we use the site: command.

                    <p>
                        not only it works for domains, it allows you to fiind information within a single website's <strong>url</strong>.

                we could go in more detail about the differences between public and college libraries. for now suffice to say that, while college libraries mainly have books that have something to do with the classes taught in the library’s college, public libraries have to meet the information needs of a much more diverse population. this is why you will be more likely to find the latest john grisham, dora roberts or children’s books in spanish at a public library rather than at a college library.
            </p>
            <p>
                when searching for books in the library catalog, start with a broad subject. remember: books usually talk about one thing for a very long time.

            </p>
            <p> this instructions are intended for a very specific library website (mhcc). your professor might give you specific instructions on how to find particular databases and journals you will need for your project.

            </p>
            <p>
                Here you can use more than one keyword and be more specific. remember, while books talk about one thing for a long time, journal articles talk about many specific things for a short time.

            </p>
            <p>
                relevant, int his context, means your keywords are present within the article somewhere. 
            </p>
            <p>
                some government websites, like the u.s. postal service, or military recruitment sites, use the .com domain.
